## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction

Analyzing business performance is a vital component of achieving success for companies. Through careful analysis, businesses can uncover their issues, vulnerabilities, and strengths. In the context of the hospitality industry, comprehending customer behavior becomes particularly crucial. This understanding allows companies to pinpoint the factors that sway customers when they're booking hotels. Moreover, it enables companies to recognize which products or services are underperforming in the market. These insights serve as a foundation for tailoring effective business strategies, ultimately enhancing the customer experience and paving the way for long-term business success.

### Objectives
This mini-project was done to:
- [x] Enhance my ability to extract and clean data using Excel and SQL.
- [x] Create informative visualization using Tableau Desktop and Tableau Public.
- [x] Give some suggestions and recommendations to improve the hotel business.

<br><br>

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Statement

Both City and Resort Hotels are experiencing downturn in their booking numbers as people would cancel their reservation after a period of time. The manager wanted to know what was the reasoning behind this and how do they overcome this situation. Come out with some recommendations that can be suggested to the hotel manager in order to improve their business.

![slide2](https://github.com/shafiqdeb/Hotel-Booking-Demand-Analysis/blob/main/slides/Slide2.PNG)

### Business Questions

1. Where do the customers come from?
2. What would affect the cancellation rate of hotel bookings? and
3. How do hotel prices and duration of stays have an impact on customer satisfaction?

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation and Cleaning

### Data Extraction
For this **EDA** (Exploratory Data Analysis) project, we will be utilizing the "Hotel booking demand" dataset. The original source of this data is the [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191) titled "Hotel Booking Demand Datasets," authored by *Nuno Antonio*, *Ana Almeida*, and *Luis Nunes*, and published in [Data in Brief](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/data-in-brief), Volume 22, in February 2019. The dataset was downloaded and subjected to cleaning procedures by *Thomas Mock* and *Antoine Bichat* during the [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-02-11) initiative in the week of February 11th, 2020.<br>

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)

The dataset consists of `29` columns and `119390` rows and held three years worth of transactions ranging from October 2014 until September 2017. It includes booking details for both City Hotel and Resort Hotel. The dataset also includes hotel reservation information such as the booking date, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and babies, as well as, the availability of parking spaces, among other attributes.

### Data Handling
Data assessment is carried out to ensure that the data used for further analysis is ready and in accordance with the analysis needs. Things to do:

- Check for `null` ‚Äã‚Äãor missing values
- Perform data type and value consistency
- Check for any outliers or unusual values 
- Drop any unnecessary columns that are not used in the analysis

<br>

Data handling summary:

| Data Assessment | Finding | Handling |
| --------------- | ------- | -------- |
| Null values or missing cells  | There are null values ‚Äã‚Äãon `company`, `city`, `children`, and `agent` columns | - `company`: filled with `0`, indicates the guest is not from any company <br> - `agent`: filled with `0`, indicates the guest made an independent reservation or not through an agent <br> - `children`: filled with `0`, indicates the guest is not bringing children to the hotel |
Inappropriate or inconsistent values | The meaning of 'Undefined' in the `meal` column | Changed 'Undefined' to `SC` that refers to Self-Catering, means customer did not request for foods |
Outliers or unusual values | There are negative values ‚Äã‚Äãand outliers that are very far from the data distribution in the column `adr`| **Deleted** the data row as it would skew the distribution|
| Unnecessary data | `name`, `email`, `phone_number` and `credit_card` columns are said to be artificially created and added into the dataset | **Dropped** the columns as it is irrelevant to be used in the analysis |

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Analysis and Interpretation

The purpose of this analysis is to gain insights into booking trends specific to each hotel type. By conducting this analysis, companies can gain a deeper understanding of market dynamics and customer preferences. This knowledge, in turn, can be leveraged to enhance operational efficiency and maximize revenue optimization strategies.

### 1. Introduction on City Hotel and Resort Hotel

According to beaches.com, the main difference between resorts and City Hotels is in the amenities. City Hotels cater to travelers who need a place to spend the night at a certain destination, while Resort Hotels tend to be destinations in themselves. Resorts often have a more spacious layout, offering their guests everything they need in one place[^1].

</details>
<br>

According to data, around 19% of hotel orders made online are canceled before the customer arrives[^2]. These cancellations can cause reduced room availability and impact hotel revenue because every empty room can be a financial burden on that day. Additionally, if a hotel uses an Online Travel Agency (OTA), this cancellation rate can impact the hotel's ranking in searches[^3].

City Hotels have a higher cancellation rate when compared to Resort Hotels. This suggests that a significant portion of customers who book City Hotels tend to cancel their reservations more frequently. One possible explanation for this trend could be the central location of City Hotels in urban areas, close to both tourist and business attractions. Such proximity may lead to customers needing to make various arrangements, and there could be additional factors that contribute to the higher cancellation rates in these urban settings.

<br>

### 2. Insights on countries with the most booking orders

From the given dataset, the hotel customers traveled from 177 distinct countries, with the most of the bookings coming from European countries, specifically in Portugal. Not only that, the top 10 of the booking orders comes from countries that have four season weather which means they most probably traveled for vacations. The distribution of countries can be seen in the map below:

<br>

The darker the greenish color indicates that more bookings are coming from that country. Portugal had the most orders with 44,584 bookings, followed by the United Kingdom with 12,128 bookings and France with 10,415 booking orders. The rest are below 10,000 orders that share the same continent as the top countries.

<br>

### 3. Comparison on total bookings and room rate per months

To investigate the factors influencing cancellation rates among customers, examine the relationship between the number of hotel bookings and the months of the year. In the line charts below, the y-axis represents the total bookings, while the x-axis represents the months, with blue lines indicating City Hotels and orange lines indicating Resort Hotels.

Both City and Resort Hotels show a steady increase in bookings as the year progresses, reaching a peak in August. Then it followed by a sharp decline in bookings for the rest of the year. This indicates that the highest number of hotel bookings occurs during the summer season, typically spanning from June to September. During this period, people are more likely to go on summer vacations, leading to increased bookings.

In August, Resort Hotels have a peak average daily room rate of $187, whereas City Hotels charge an average of $115 per night. When comparing the number of bookings canceled due to price surges, August stands out with the highest cancellation rates compared to other months. This observation suggests that an increase in room rates, especially during the peak summer season, may be a key reason for customers canceling their hotel bookings. Understanding these patterns can help hotels better manage pricing strategies and potentially reduce cancellation rates during peak seasons.

### 4. Correlation on week of stay against the cancellation rate

To analyze the impact of the duration of customer stays on booking cancellations, divide the data into two categories: stays during weeknights (Monday to Friday) and stays during weekend nights (Saturday and Sunday) as shown in the column bar chart below:

**Weeknight Stays:**

- For stays less than a week (short stays), there's a significant cancellation rate, with City Hotels having a cancellation rate of more than 25%. However, this rate decreases dramatically in the following weeks. This suggests that many customers initially book for short stays but then cancel their reservations, possibly because they found alternative accommodations or changed their plans.
- In contrast, Resort Hotels show a relatively steady increase in cancellations as the duration of stay extends throughout the week. This could indicate that guests may become dissatisfied with the hotel's services or amenities during longer stays, leading to cancellations.


**Weekend Stays:**

- In the case of weekend stays, there's a notable surge in cancellations for stays of less than a week for City Hotels, accounting for nearly 40% of the total cancellations. However, this cancellation rate decreases linearly with longer stays. This suggests that customers booking City Hotels for weekend getaways may be more likely to cancel if they initially plan for shorter trips.
- For Resort Hotels, there isn't a clear linear pattern in the cancellation rates based on the duration of the stay. However, most of the cancellation rates for Resort Hotels are below 15%, which is relatively low compared to City Hotels.
- These findings highlight the need for improvements in the hotel industry, especially for City Hotels, where higher cancellation rates are observed compared to Resort Hotels. These improvements may encompass service quality, pricing strategies, and other factors that influence customer satisfaction and booking cancellations. Understanding these patterns can help hotels take proactive measures to reduce cancellations and enhance the overall guest experience.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Summary and Recommendation

![slide9](https://github.com/shafiqdeb/Hotel-Booking-Demand-Analysis/blob/main/slides/Slide9.PNG)

In summary, City Hotels are the preferred choice for most customers, and there's a noticeable surge in bookings during holiday seasons, particularly from June to September. Based on these observations, here are some business recommendations:

1. **Enhance Resort Hotels**: Given the lower booking rates for Resort Hotels, companies can focus on optimizing their facilities and services to attract more customers. Consider adding amenities like spas, gyms, or swimming pools to improve the overall guest experience. Providing personalized and friendly customer service can also make a significant difference.

2. **Boost Promotions During Peak Seasons**: During holiday seasons, consider implementing promotional strategies to attract more guests. Special discounts for guests booking multiple rooms or enticing holiday packages can be effective. To minimize booking cancellations, think about introducing non-refundable booking options.

3. **Flexible Pricing for Off-Peak Times**: During low season periods, companies can adopt a combination of flexible and non-refundable rates to attract guests. Offering special but non-refundable discounts can help maintain bookings even during less busy times.

<br>

The cancellation rate increases as the length of stay in both types of hotels increases. City Hotels' cancellation rate increased significantly with the lowest percentage for a duration of less than one week. Resort hotels also tend to experience an increase in cancellation rates, but they are more stagnant and for stays of less than 2 weeks and more than 1 month the cancellation rate tends to be lower. Based on the insights about cancellation rates and the length of stay at both types of hotels, here are some business recommendations:

1. **Establish Clear Cancellation Policies**: It is essential for companies to have well-defined cancellation policies in place to protect against revenue loss. These policies should be communicated clearly to customers both during online and offline booking processes. They should encompass details about refunds, cancellation fees, and other terms and conditions. Implementing stricter cancellation policies can help deter fraudulent bookings and minimize revenue impact.

2. **Optimize Pricing Strategies**: Consider implementing a pricing strategy that includes limiting the number of overnight stays. For flexible rates, you can set a one-week window for maximum stays, reducing the risk of unwanted cancellations. Additionally, offer non-refundable rates for longer stays to increase revenue and discourage last-minute cancellations.

3. **Enhance Pre-Stay Services**: To prevent cancellations, focus on improving customer satisfaction by providing excellent pre-stay services. Engage with customers before their arrival, addressing their questions or concerns promptly. Personalized and attentive service can build loyalty and reduce the likelihood of guests canceling their reservations.

<br>
By implementing these recommendations, both City and Resort Hotels can effectively manage lead times and reduce cancellation rates, ultimately improving revenue and guest satisfaction.
